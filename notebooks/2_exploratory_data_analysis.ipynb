    "On an auction website, human bidders are becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to win auctions vs. their software-controlled counterparts. As a result, usage from the site's core customer base is plummeting. In order to rebuild customer happiness, the site owners need to eliminate computer generated bidding from their auctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to identify online auction bids that are placed by \"robots\", helping the site owners easily flag these users for removal from their site to prevent unfair auction activity.\n",

    "3. Response time: Robots might bid more often, so time between each bid will be shorter than for humans' bid.\n",
